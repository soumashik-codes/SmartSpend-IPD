# SmartSpend – Predictive Personal Finance Tracker (IPD Prototype)

This repository contains the **Interim Progress Demonstration (IPD)** prototype for the
Final Year Project **SmartSpend – Predictive Personal Finance Tracker**.

## Live Prototype
The prototype is hosted using Streamlit Cloud:

👉**Live App:**  
https://smartspend-ipd-n7yubpb9ceuyeizxcpwiyi.streamlit.app
If the app is temporarily unavailable due to deployment delays/Streamlit errors, please refresh after a few minutes or try running locally.

## How to run locally
1) Create virtual environment (Windows)
python -m venv .venv  
.venv\Scripts\activate

2) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3) Run the application
streamlit run app.py

## Login
Create an account using the **Create Account** tab, then log in to access the dashboard
and features.

## Notes (IPD Stage)
- All data is stored locally using SQLite (`db/smartspend.db`)
- No external bank APIs are used (privacy-preserving design)
- Receipt OCR uses **Tesseract OCR** and requires it to be installed locally
  (optional / partial implementation at IPD stage)
