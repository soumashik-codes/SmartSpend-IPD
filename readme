# SmartSpend – Predictive Personal Finance Tracker (IPD Prototype)

This repository contains the **Interim Progress Demonstration (IPD)** prototype for the
Final Year Project **SmartSpend – Predictive Personal Finance Tracker**.

## Live Prototype
The prototype is hosted using Streamlit Cloud:

👉**Live App:**  
https://smartspend-ipd-n7yubpb9ceuyeizxcpwiyi.streamlit.app
If the app is temporarily unavailable due to deployment issues/Streamlit errors, please refresh after a few minutes or try running locally.

## How to run locally
1) Create virtual environment (Windows)
python -m venv .venv  
.venv\Scripts\activate

2) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3) Run the application
streamlit run app.py

## Login
Create an account using the **Create Account** tab, then log in to access the dashboard
and features.

## Notes (IPD Stage)
- All data is stored locally using SQLite (`db/smartspend.db`)
- No external bank APIs are used (privacy-preserving design)
- Receipt OCR uses **Tesseract OCR** and requires it to be installed locally
  (optional / partial implementation at IPD stage)

The application functions correctly in a local environment and when run via the
repository source code.

The Streamlit Cloud deployment may encounter a dependency-related issue, which can prevent the hosted version from loading in some cases.
This is an environment limitation of Streamlit Cloud rather than an application
logic issue.

All core functionality and features can be reviewed by running the application
locally using the steps above.
